The code from Generative Deep Learning by David Foster rewritten with PyTorch. 

The book Generative Deep Learning by David Foster [link](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/generative-deep-learning/9781098134174/) is an incredible book for learning. Unfortunately it has one major flaw. The code examples are only in TensorFlow which is an outdated framework well on its way to be forgetten by the community. This repo contains all the code for the book but in PyTorch. This way learning can go through this fantastic book with the correct framework.
